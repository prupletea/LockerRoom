# LockerRoom
CS Girlies November Hackaton - Make Learning Cool Again!

## Idea
The main idea is to have a unified platform for keeping track of assignments, grades, for studying and more, while also making it feel like a game. Locker Room - because it's where you keep everything necessary to reach your academic goals! Inside your space-themed locker lives a little creature - an alien and completing each assignment or task makes your little companion happier!

## Inspirations
Habitica and the fact that I do all of my tracking on Google Sheets. 

## Technologies used
Figma

## Submition Track
Make Learning Fun: Gamify the Learning Journey! 👾

## Sidenote
Two hours after the Hackathon started, my building lost electricity...

## Future of the project
I plan on continuing this project once the hackathon judging is finished. Some things I plan on implementing:
- lo-fi beats player;
- settings bar where you can name your alien;
- working adjustable pomodoro timer;
- grade calculator;
- and hopefully much more!!!
